 * back in USDC. Two parties stand in front of that signature and both ask
 * the same question, so both ask it here: the relay route on the server,
 * which anyone on the internet can call without ever running the wallet, and
 * the wallet itself before the portfolio signs. Neither takes the other's
 * word. A transaction is one of the few exact shapes below or it is refused;
 * there is no "close enough".
 *
 * Everything is decided from the transaction and the pinned keys alone,
 * with no chain read, so the route can refuse before it spends anything.
 * "Owned by the portfolio" therefore means "is the portfolio's associated
 * token account", which is an address that can be derived.
 *
